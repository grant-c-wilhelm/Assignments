Looking to meet people in the area she downloaded the Bumble Application, a dating and friend finding appplication.  There she and Grant BOTH swiped right! They exhcanged numbers and Grant let Ali know to "shoot him a text when she moves here if she needs help moving". Both went on with their lives for the next two months.  Then, in September 2017, Ali had offically moved to Salt Lake City.  The two went out the following Friday night.  You could say, thats all she wrote folks!!</p>
