                <p className="main-story-text">Grant and Ali both moved to Salt Lake City in 2017. Ali was pursuing a new job after living in Dallas, Texas for 2 years. Grant was stationed in the Air Force and moved from Jacksonville, Florida.
                After unexpectedly crossing paths just one week after Ali moved to town, some would say it was love at first sight. Both made an immediate connection over their love for food, wine, and music.
                The year is now 2020, and the two have found a love for the mountains and even more so with each other!!</p>
